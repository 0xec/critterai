This branch contains the study version of NMGen. It is static and,
along with http://www.critterai.org/nmgen/study, exists as a tool
to study the automatic generation of navigation meshes.

>>> No updates are scheduled for this branch <<<<

See the NMGen project home URL (below) for information on active development.

------------------------------------------

NMGen is an adaptation in Java of Recast's static mesh functionality
for purposes of study and experimentation.  NMGen takes an arbitrary
triangle mesh as input and generates data representing the 
traversable surface of the source mesh. 

Recast is a C++ navigation mesh construction toolset created by 
Mikko Mononen and released under the MIT license.
