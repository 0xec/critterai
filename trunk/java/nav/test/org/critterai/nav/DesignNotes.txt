Design notes for org.critterai.nav.junit

This test suite covers the classes in org.critterai.nav.

Since the code base represents a prototype, to save time most of these 
tests do not follow unit testing standards.

In general, the more lower level the class, the more thorough the testing.  
Higher level classes are tested less thoroughly and often assume proper 
functioning of the lower level classes.

For lower level classes:  

- Few assumptions are made about the internal operations of the class.
- Minimal optimizations due to knowledge about how the class works.
- Minimal dependencies on functionality in other classes in the same library.

For higher level classes:

- Tests designed in such a way that they will fail if classes they depend on
  are not functioning properly.
- Tests are more often designed based on knowledge of how the class works
  internally.
- For wrapper functions, tests already performed on the wrapped class
  functions are generally not re-performed.

Test Meshes

The implementation of generalized test meshes via the ITestMesh interface
is a good way along, but only partially complete.  Test suites will need review
and upgrades before different meshes can be swapped in and out at will.
