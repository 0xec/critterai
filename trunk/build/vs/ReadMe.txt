Notes:

The are no automatic builds for .NET.

Projects whose names include 'u3d' in the name depend on Unity (http://unity3d.com/).
Most require Unity Pro.

The Visual Studio projects were created on a 64-bit version of Windows, so the
Unity DLL reference will be broken on 32-bit Windows.

For Unity 3.x, the expected location of the DLL for both operating systems is 
as follows:

Windows 32-bit: C:\Program Files\Unity\Editor\Data\Managed
Windows 64-bit: C:\Program Files (x86)\Unity\Editor\Data\Managed\
