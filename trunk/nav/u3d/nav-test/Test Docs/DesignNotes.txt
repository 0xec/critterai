Design notes for org.critterai.nav.junit

This test suite covers the classes in the CAINav library.

While coverage is pretty good, most tests are not proper xUnit tests.  If the 
project moves beyond the prototype state the test format will be improved.

In general, the more lower level the class, the more thorough the testing.  
Higher level classes are tested less thoroughly and often assume proper 
functioning of the lower level classes.

For lower level classes:  

- Few assumptions are made about the internal operations of the class.
- Test optimizations based on knowledge about how the class works is minimal.
- Minimal dependencies on functionality in other classes in the same library.

For higher level classes:

- Tests are designed in such a way that they will fail if classes they depend 
on are not functioning properly.
- Tests are more often designed based on knowledge of how the class works 
  internally.
- For wrapper functions, tests already performed on the wrapped class 
  functions are usually not re-performed.

Test Meshes

The implementation of generalized test meshes via the ITestMesh interface
is a good way along, but still only partially complete.  Test suites will 
need review and upgraded before different meshes can be swapped in and out 
at will.
