/**
 * Provides various geometry related classes and operations.
 * <p>A high priority is given to performance.  In order to achieve the performance goal, the
 * following standards have been implemented:</p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>There is no validation of arguments outside of constructors.
 * For example, the 
 * {@link org.critterai.math.geom.Line2#getRelationship(float, float, float, float, float, float, float, float, org.critterai.math.Vector2)}
 * operation does not validate that the {@link org.critterai.math.Vector2} argument is non-null.  
 * If the argument is null a runtime error will occur.</li>
 * <li>All static operations that return an object require the object be passed in as an "out" argument.
 * The out object is updated with the result and its reference returned.  This reduces the construction
 * costs by allowing clients of the class to re-use the out objects for multiple calls.</p>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
