Each project has its own root directory which is located within a directory
indicating its language or target platform.

For example: 

The java utility project is under /java/util.
The Unity3D utility project is under /u3d/util.

For Java the standard project directory structure is as follows:

project directory
    build files     : Ant
    test directory  : Test source.
    src directory   : Project source.
